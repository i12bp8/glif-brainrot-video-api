# Background Music

Place your background music files in this directory. These will be mixed with the main audio at a lower volume in generated videos.

## Requirements

- **Format**: MP3 files only
- **Duration**: Ideally 1-3 minutes per track
- **Volume**: Already normalized (not too loud or too quiet)
- **Style**: Subtle, non-distracting background music works best
- **Rights**: Ensure you have the rights to use the music

## Example

You should have files like:
- `background_track_1.MP3`
- `background_track_2.MP3`
- etc.

## Note

The system will randomly select one of these tracks for each video generation.
